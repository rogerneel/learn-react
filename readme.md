# Learn React

Wes Bos' Rails for Beginners tutorial. Highly recommended to begin learning React. This repo has 2 apps: the React tutorial catch-of-the-day app and a Redux implementation of it, refactored from the original app.

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies in each of the apps. 

Then run `npm start`.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
